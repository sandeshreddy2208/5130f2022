Being an esports player myself I know what it is to have poor setup and not having sufficient funds to upgrade to a better one. We thought of making this website inorder to help a lot of people get some help to get the in game content/micro transactions and the gear they wanted.This Idea was back in my undergraduation days. The paper involves writing  the technologies that I was supposed to use to make the website, the backstory for the idea, the Introduction, Abstract, working of the application and a conclusion.
