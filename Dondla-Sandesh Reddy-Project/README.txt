Students find it difficult going to a store and getting the cake might be a hassle and it costs a lot for a cab. so customizing the cake online will save the consumer some money and time, seeing it on a long run it is  going to save us a lot. Most of the stores  have predefined shapes and flavours. So, our aim is to provide all types of shapes, sizes 
 and flavours according to the consumer preferences. So, when the user enters their pin code the website displays a bunch of stores in their surroundings and if it is not according to their liking they can increase their search radius and continue their search.
After that they can customise their cake the way they want and send an order to the store. So, after receiving the order the store and the user gets a message of the cake's ETA. So, for a structured data to be transfered from the website to the store/consumer, we are thinking of sending a link which will have the picture of the cake and followed by the other selections that the consumer have selected.
